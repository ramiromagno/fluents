Description: An opinionated R package re-implementation of grind.R
    <https://tbb.bio.uu.nl/rdb/grindR.html> by Rob de Boer, Theoretical
    Biology and Bioinformatics, University of Utrecht. grind.R, in turn,
    is a port of the C-based program GRIND (GReat INtegrator Differential equations)
    <https://tbb.bio.uu.nl/rdb/grindC.html> to R, from the same author.
    This package API has more functions that do less each, while grind.R's
    has fewer functions that do more each.
